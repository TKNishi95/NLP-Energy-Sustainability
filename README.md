# NLP-Energy-Sustainability-Project

The goal of this project is to utilize contemporary Topic Modeling and Name Entity Recognition techniques to analyze sustainability reports published between 2018 and 2024 by major US energy firms (including: Chevron, Oxy, Haliburton, ExxonMobil). 

Background:
As early as the 1980s, sustainability reports published by companies have played a significant role in addressing their commitment to the growing public interest in climate, social, and corporate governance issues. Major US energy firms, mentioned above (and others), have leveraged these reports as a tool to communicate their societal and environmental responsibilities to domestic and international audiences. This has become more poignant in the late 2010s with the advent of the Paris Agreement, the SDGs, and the ESG initiative. 

Yet, the global turmoil of the current decade, starting with the COVID-19 pandemic, followed closely by the war in Ukraine, and the geopolitical rivalry between the US and China, has arguably led to the deprioritization of "sustainability" (whether environmental or governance-related matters). Among investors, and critically, among companies alike, a growing prioritization of operational survivability, productivity, and secure supply chains has emerged.

Goals of the Project:
This project aims to analyze and uncover how major US energy firms' language in their annual (depending on the firm) sustainability reports has evolved between 2018 and 2024. Leveraging currently available NLP tools, as well as a large language model, we aim to identify notable trends, such as issues that were once highlighted but have been dropped or deemphasized over the years, or whether certain firms, like Chevron, emphasize governance heavily while Oxy focuses predominantly on environmental targets. 

Given that these firms possess enormous economic and political sway, not just in the US, that can impact environmental and governance policies, this project can shed light to how they position themselves in these matters for the past several years.
