# NLP-Energy-Sustainability-Project

The goal of this project is to utilize contemporary Topic Modeling and Name Entity Recognition techniques to analyze sustainability reports published between 2018 and 2024 by major US energy firms (including: Chevron, Oxy, Haliburton, ExxonMobil). 


## **Background:**

Since the 1980s, corporate sustainability reports have served as a key tool for companies to communicate their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments to stakeholders. In recent years, these reports have taken on heightened importance amid global initiatives like the Paris Agreement, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and growing investor emphasis on ESG performance.

However, the landscape in the 2020s has become more complex. Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and evolving U.S.–China dynamics have introduced new operational and geopolitical pressures. This project aims to investigate how, or whether, external forces have impacted the emphasis, framing, or tone of ESG and sustainability messaging within the energy sector.


## **Goals of the Project:**

- Analyze ESG language trends across major energy firms' sustainability reports (2018–2024)

- Use Topic Modeling and NER to surface recurring themes, emerging risks, or declining focus areas

- Compare firms to see how focus areas vary (e.g., environmental targets vs. governance themes)

By applying contemporary NLP tools to these reports, the project aims to contribute a data-driven perspective on how energy companies are positioning their ESG commitments in a rapidly evolving global environment.


## **Importance**

Energy firms have substantial influence in shaping public policy, investor priorities, and sustainability narratives. Understanding how they communicate these values over time offers insight into both corporate strategy and the broader evolution of ESG and sustainability discourse in the U.S. energy sector.
